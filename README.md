# D-Majeur
D-Majeur is a minesweeper based game created by Tom and Imad at their first year in CY-TECH.

To lunch our minesweeper game, you first have to download the .zip file on your computer, then extract it somwhere into a secure repository. After that, in terminal, you should use the tool "Make" in order to compile the modules. Once the compilation is done, you can now execute the game via the command ./D-Majeur.
